# PowerPlant

The application is based on the 3rd party PowerPlantDataProvider library, whose task is to generate operating parameters data of power plant componentry.
Basically simple app to monitor power plant live statistics and highlight critical anomalies.

Practice for ex.:
- Clean Architecture design
- ADO.NET database handling
- writing to files with JSON conversion
